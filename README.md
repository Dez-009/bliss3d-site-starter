# Bliss3D Site Starter

This repository provides a small static website used as a marketing landing page for **Bliss 3D**. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and showcases a hero section with video, service cards and simple scroll animations.

## Project structure

- `index.html` – main page markup
- `style.css` – styling used across the page
- `script.js` – basic navigation and scroll-triggered animation
- `bliss3d-logo.png` – Bliss 3D logo used in the navbar
- `hero-video.mp4` – video displayed in the hero section

## Running locally

No build steps are required. You can open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the directory with any static file server, for example:

```bash
npx http-server .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080` (or whichever port is shown) to view the site.
